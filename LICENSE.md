1. Purpose and Scope

The Dust Open Documentation License (DODL) v2.0 is an open license for documentation that embodies technical, scientific, mathematical, architectural, or computational concepts, including those that may be patentable or implementation-enabling.

This License is intended to ensure that such documentation remains freely usable, implementable, and extensible, while preventing enclosure through hostile patent assertions or proprietary appropriation.

⸻

2. Definitions

“Documentation” means any written, diagrammatic, symbolic, or formal material, including but not limited to:
	•	Text, papers, specifications, manuals
	•	Mathematical formalisms, axioms, proofs
	•	Diagrams, schematics, figures
	•	Conceptual architectures and design descriptions
	•	Examples, pseudocode, or reference models

“Work” means the Documentation distributed under this License.

“Contributor” means any individual or entity that authors, modifies, or submits Documentation for inclusion in the Work.

“You” means any individual or entity exercising rights under this License.

“Implementation” means any realization, instantiation, or construction derived from the Work, including software, hardware, mathematical systems, physical devices, simulations, or hybrid systems.

3. Grant of Rights

Subject to the terms of this License, the Licensor grants You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to:
	•	Use, read, study, and analyze the Work
	•	Copy and redistribute the Work
	•	Modify, adapt, and build upon the Work
	•	Create Implementations based on the Work
	•	Publish, present, and teach the Work or derivatives thereof

⸻

4. Patent License Grant

Each Contributor hereby grants You a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable patent license to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit any Implementation that would otherwise infringe any patent claims necessarily embodied by their Contribution to the Work.

This patent license applies whether the Implementation is:
	•	Direct or indirect
	•	Literal or conceptual
	•	Software, hardware, mathematical, or physical

For avoidance of doubt:
If a concept is disclosed in the Work, it may be implemented without fear of patent assertion by Contributors.

⸻

5. Patent Retaliation and Termination

If You initiate or participate in any patent claim, lawsuit, or legal action alleging that the Work or any Implementation thereof infringes a patent, then:
	•	All rights granted to You under this License terminate immediately and automatically
	•	This termination applies to both Documentation and patent licenses
	•	Reinstatement is not automatic and requires explicit written permission from the Licensor

This provision is a core condition of this License.

6. Contributions

Any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work shall be deemed licensed under this License in full.

By contributing, You represent that:
	•	You have the right to grant the licenses described herein
	•	Your Contribution does not knowingly violate third-party rights
	•	You grant the patent license described in Section 4 for your Contribution

The Work is provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of correctness, completeness, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

In no event shall the Licensor or Contributors be liable for any damages arising from use of the Work or any Implementation thereof, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

12. Governing Intent

This License shall be interpreted to:
	•	Preserve openness of knowledge
